# LotteryCalculator
An app that calculates how many years it would take to win the lottery. This is my first project. I made it after studying programming for about 3 months.
# Want to be a millionaire?
Would you like to win the lottery? Who wouldnÂ´t. Well fear not, now you can see if you are lucky enough to win the lottery, without having to actually buy any lottery tickets! You simply input your lucky numbers into the app, that I created, and you shall finally realize how truly unlikely it is to win a lottery.

# Features
You can input your lucky numbers one by one in the command prompt (as shown in the screenshot) or input them as a command line argument directly.
